                <h2>Rhinoceros</h2>
                <p>Currently, there are about 20,000 white rhinos in Africa, 
                    classified as Near Extinction according to the IUCN. 
                    Sadly, the last remaining wild population of the northern white rhino subspecies will soon become extinct, 
                    as only two females remain in captivity. 
                    Africa still has about 5,000 black rhinos, classified as <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/">Critically Endangered</a> by the IUCN. 
                    The western black rhino subspecies were confirmed to be extinct in November 2011. 
                    Three species of rhino, black, Javan, and Sumatran, are also critically endangered. 
                    Today, a small population of Javan rhinos is found only in one national park on the northern tip of the Indonesian island of Java</p>

                    <h3>Reason</h3>
                    <p>Rhino poaching increased in the 1970s and 1980s due to the high demand for 
                        <a href="https://www.savetherhino.org/thorny-issues/tackling-the-demand-for-rhino-horn/">Rhino Horns</a> 
                        in Asia and the Middle East. 
                        Rhino poaching is the biggest threat to rhino populations. 
                        Countries in East Asia and Southeast Asia still have a huge demand for rhino horns. 
                        They are said to be a panacea, as well as a symbol of power that many royal and noble individuals desire</p>

                <h2>Emperor Penguins</h2>
                <p>According to the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), large storms in 2017 and 2018 occurred continuously, 
                    claiming the lives of a series of young penguins in this area. 
                    Research by scientists from the <a href="https://www.whoi.edu/know-your-ocean/ocean-topics/ocean-life/sea-birds/emperor-penguins/">Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute</a>(US) 
                    shows that the number of individuals in emperor penguin populations will decline by at least 19% by 2100. 
                    About two-thirds of the current 45 emperor penguin populations are at risk of more than a 50% decline, and about one-fifth of the population faces “near extinction”, 
                    the research suggested. 
                    The reason being is due to global warming that is causing the ice area in Antarctica to decrease. 
                    Melting ice will affect the reproduction and rearing of emperor penguins since their activities mainly take place on sea ice. 
                    Moreover, melting ice also affects fish and krill, which are the main food of emperor penguins.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Reason</h3>
                    <p>However, the degree of individual decline in emperor penguin populations varies. 
                        Penguin populations living in areas from the Eastern Weddell Sea to the Western Indian Ocean are most likely at risk of decreasing,
                        while populations living in the Ross Sea will be less affected. 
                        Scientists are now calling for the emperor penguin to be listed as 
                        <a href="https://biologicaldiversity.org/w/news/press-releases/emperor-penguin-proposed-for-us-endangered-species-protection-2021-08-03/#:~:text=A%202021%20study%20by%20leading,threats%20from%20sea%2Dice%20loss.">“endangered”</a>
                        (threatened from extinction) in the Red List of the IUCN. 
                        Concurrently, it has proposed the establishment of a marine reserve in the Ross Sea and 
                        off the eastern coast of Antarctica as a way to restrict tourism and fishing activities in this area in order to preserve the habitat of the species.</p>

        <section class="section4">
            <div class="text-container2">
                <h2>Sumatran Elephants</h2>
                <p>In 2011, the IUCN listed the Sumatran elephant as critically endangered and over the past two decades, 
                    the species population has decreased by about 35%, from about 2,652 to 1,724 individuals, according to information from <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-indonesia-elephant-idINTRE80N05Q20120124/">WWF Indonesia</a></p>
                    
                    <h3>Reason</h3>
                    <p>There are two main reasons that drive the Sumatran elephant to the brink of extinction. 
                        Firstly, due to the shrinking habitat; forests are being converted into residential areas, agricultural production, and plantations, 
                        which in turn often leads to deaths related to conflict and fragmentation of the elephant populations. 
                        Secondly, Sumatran elephants are still a target of poaching due to their tusks.</p>

        <!--Section 5 Sumatran Tiger-->
        <section class="section5">         
            <div class="text-container3">
                <h2>Sumatran Tiger</h2>
                <p>The Sumatran tiger is the only surviving tiger species of the Sunda Islands and has been classified as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List since 2008. 
                    According to an estimate made by the Indonesian Ministry of Environment and Forestry in December 2018, the Sumatran tiger population has no more than 600 individuals left, 
                    and is facing risks such as habitat loss and poaching. Sumatran tigers are in great demand in the illegal trade market, where animal parts are valued for local medicinal and 
                    souvenirs purposes. The entire body of a tiger can cost $10,000, which motivates poachers on the island that are unable to find legitimate work that provides the same pay. 
                    Although the Sumatran tigers are protected from global human trafficking, 
                    they are still experiencing political instability and lack the necessary resources to enforce protections. 
                    In addition, many tigers have been killed by locals, who consider them a threat to both the animals on the farm and their people.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Reason</h3>
                    <p>Habitat loss as a result of deforestation, especially at lower altitudes, is another significant threat to the remaining Sumatran tiger population. 
                        Deforestation, which occurs to make space for palm oil production, leads to the destruction and fragmentation of tiger habitats. 
                        Other factors that contribute to deforestation are population growth and urban development. Multiple researchers reported that this tiger species will soon be restricted to 
                        just 20% of the remaining forest area in Sumatra. 
                        This loss of habitat also leads to a decrease in the number of other animals that are the food source of the Sumatran tigers.</p>

                <h2>Vaquita Dolphin</h2>
                <p>The government of Mexico announced on July 14 2021 new measures to protect the critically endangered <a href="https://earth.org/data_visualization/2021-the-year-that-could-save-or-kill-the-vaquita/">vaquita dolphin</a>, 
                    claiming it to be one of the rarest marine mammals in the world right now. Mexico has long faced pressure to come up with more solutions to protect the vaquita, 
                    the world's smallest dolphin species with the nickname “ocean panda” for its distinctive black circle around the eyes. 
                    Conservationists estimate that there are only 10 vaquita dolphins left in the wild, and the number is dropping fast. </p>
                    
                    <h3>Reason</h3>
                    <p>This dolphin species is reported to be on the verge of extinction due to the amount of illegal fishing in the Gulf of California. 
                        The new rules, according to Mexico’s National Fisheries and Aquaculture Commission, are said to aim at enhancing the power to monitor fishing activities in the northern 
                        Gulf of California, the only place on Earth where vaquita dolphins are found. At more depth, it can partially or completely ban fishing boats from operating in the Gulf of 
                        California for up to one month if such hunting activities are found. 
                        The committee also stressed the importance of protecting the core zone of the reserve, where all commercial fishing is prohibited.</p>
